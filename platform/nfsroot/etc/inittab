# Note, BusyBox init doesn't support runlevels.  The runlevels field is
# completely ignored by BusyBox init. If you want runlevels, use sysvinit.
#
#
# Format for each entry: <id>:<runlevels>:<action>:<process>
#
# id        == tty to run on, or empty for /dev/console
# runlevels == ignored
# action    == one of sysinit, wait, once, respawn, askfirst,
#                       shutdown, restart and ctrlaltdel.
# process   == program to run

# Startup the system
::sysinit:/bin/mount -a

# Now run any rc scripts
::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS

# Start an "askfirst" shell on the console (whatever that may be)
::askfirst:/bin/sh

# Stuff to do when restarting the init process
::restart:/sbin/init

# Stuff to do before rebooting
::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/reboot
::shutdown:/etc/init.d/rcK
::shutdown:/bin/umount -a -r
